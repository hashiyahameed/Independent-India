        India will celebrate its 75th Independence Day on August 15, 2021, across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic. To celebrate 75 years of independence and commemorate it as ‘Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav’, the Government of India has called upon people to submit videos of them singing the national anthem. The Union home ministry has issued instructions to the states and Union Territories to follow necessary preventive measures while organising the Independence Day celebrations.The Delhi government on Monday kicked off celebrations to mark the 75th year of India’s Independence with a ceremonial run from the Delhi secretariat to Raj Ghat.
        India's Independence Day is significant as it stands as a reminder of the sacrifices that many freedom fighters made to get independence from British rule.
