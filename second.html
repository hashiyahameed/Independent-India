            India will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day on August 15, 2021, with the usual pride as on this day India got its freedom from British rule.
            Following the victory of the British at the Battle of Plassey, the East India Company began its rule in India in 1757. The Indian Independence movement began during World War I and was led by Mohandas Karamdas Gandhi. On August 15, 1947, India got its freedom, ending an almost 200-year British rule.<bbr></bbr>

            The Indian Independence Bill was introduced in the British House of Commons on July 4, 1947, and passed within a fortnight. It provided for the end of British rule in India on August 15, 1947. After that, India became a free country with the bifurcation of India and Pakistan.

<br>Some of the great freedom fighters who helped in India's freedom struggle include Mahatma Gandhi, Rani Lakshmi Bai, Bhagat Singh, Mangal Pandey, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Subhas Chandra Bose and many more.<br>

            India's Independence Day is significant as it stands as a reminder of the sacrifices that many freedom fighters made to get independence from British rule. It is a national holiday and it is usually observed throughout the nation with the hoisting of the tricolour, parades and cultural events. In commemoration of the day, India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of Red Fort in Delhi on August 15, 1947. It is a tradition that has since then been followed by the incumbent Prime Minister, followed by an address to the country.
